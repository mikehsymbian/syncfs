  FAQ (or, an imagined conversation with someone looking at this project
==========================================================================

1. What is this? What does it do?

It's a synchronising filesystem, meant for automatically sending out changes
to a bunch of servers when new files get written.

2. What doesn't it do?

Sync-on-read and locking.

3. But that sucks.

Yes, we know. We just wanted to send files out to listening servers as
quickly as possible. Absolute consistency and file locking wasn't needed.

4. The code sucks.

There's a bit of copy-n-paste going on, yes. It was "oh dear, the site is
down, we need a solution NOW because the current solution is making
kittens die," implementation. It's better than it was, and can be better still.

5. You depend on csync2 for full synchronisation if a node goes down
and comes back up.

Yes. Yes we do. See number 4.

6. But... but... it works! And it's relatively fast... and... well,
I kinda like it.

Yeah, us too. Plus, it does the sending of files before the file handle is
released, so that you can sleep soundly knowing your file is on all servers
when you complete your write.

7. What about... when a file read is requested and the file doesn't
exist, it contacts other servers to find if a copy exists somewhere else.

Yep, that would be good.

8. And.. and... yeah! How about, after reading, a check on if an updated
version of the file exists anywhere?

Ummm, possibly.

9. Cake is nice.

Indeed. Most indeededly so.
